# ember-oauth-client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mariogintili/ember-oauth-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mariogintili/ember-oauth-client)

This is a fully functional demo app using the OAUTH2 grant type `"password"`. Done for teaching purposes

This project works **out-of-the-box** :godmode: with another project I built called **[Backend](https://github.com/mariogintili/backend)**

If you're new to Ember and Ember-CLI please feel free to skim through this app, I believe it entails good practices and clean code :monkey:
